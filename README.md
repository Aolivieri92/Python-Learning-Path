# Python-Learning-Path
Here are projects that demonstrate my progressing knowledge in Python
They are mostly sourced from tutorials on youtube
Later when I am more comfortable I want to add my own projects. I will include in the file if they are orginal. Otherwise, they are from tutorial walk throughs...
because..... well you know you gotta start somewhere.
